# my-demo
This is my first Git Hub repository. The readme file is to bascially give a description about your project 
<br>
useing basic html helps me come to the next line 
Getting familiar with basic commands:
1. git clone link . here enter the link of the repository you want to clone to your laptop from github
2. cd newFolderName . this is to change directory 
3. ls . this is to get all the visible files in a folder
4. ls -a. this is to get all the hidden as well as visible files in a folder 
5. git status. tell you the status of the main respository you have cloned from git hub
6. now the status can have 4 possible outcomes 
a. modified. this means a file was edited without commiting the changes
b. untracked. this refers to file which was added after cloning and git hub has no idea about this file
c. staged. this is the stage when the changes are added and just have to be commited
d. unmodified. the repo is as it is
7. git add fileName. this is to adds new or changes files from your working repo to the git staging area
8. git add. . this is to add all the changes i have made in case if many changes exist to the git staging area
9. git commit -m" Add Some Meaningfull Message " . this is the record of changes 
10. git push origin main . this is to push local repo content to remote repo 
11. cd .. this is to come back to the main directory 
12. mkdir folderName. this is to make a new folder in the current directory 
13. git init . this is applied to a directory to make it a git repo
14. git remote add origin remoteLink . 
15. git remote -v . to verify remote
16. git branch . this tell you the name of all the available branches . branches are different copies of the repo used by different teams
17. git branch -M Newname . this is to rename your current branch 
18. git pull origin main. this is used to fetch and download content from a remote repo and immedietly update the local repo to match that content
19. git diff main . this is to get the differences of my current branch with my main branch 
20. if i want to merge branches using the git hub itself then i have to compare and pull requestgit
21. resolving merge conflic is an event that takes place when git is autmatically not able to resolve differences in code between 2 commits
22. conflict arises while merging only when there is a difference between the same line 
23. git checkout -b your-branch-name. this is to create a new branch 
24. git push -u origin your-branch-name. this is to push branch to github. Think of it as setting a default "target" for future pushes and pulls. -u means setting upstream. After this, Git will remember:
"Okay, when I'm on feature1, I’ll push to origin/feature1 on GitHub."
25. This is the name of the remote repository — by default, origin refers to the GitHub repo you cloned from or are pushing to.
