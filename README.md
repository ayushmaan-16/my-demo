# my-demo
This is my first Git Hub repository. The readme file is to bascially give a description about your project 
<br>
useing basic html helps me come to the next line 
Getting familiar with basic commands:
1. git clone link . here enter the link of the repository you want to clone to your laptop from github
2. cd newFolderName . this is to change directory 
3. ls . this is to get all the visible files in a folder
4. ls -a. this is to get all the hidden as well as visible files in a folder 
5. git status. tell you the status of the main respository you have cloned from git hub
6. now the status can have 4 possible outcomes 
a. modified. this means a file was edited without commiting the changes
b. untracked. this refers to file which was added after cloning and git hub has no idea about this file
c. staged. this is the stage when the changes are added and just have to be commited
d. unmodified. the repo is as it is
7. git add fileName. this is to adds new or changes files from your working repo to the git staging area
8. git add. . this is to add all the changes i have made in case if many changes exist to the git staging area
9. git commit -m" Add Some Meaningfull Message " . this is the record of changes 
10. git push origin main . this is to push local repo content to remote repo
